						<dt>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</dt>
						<dd>ART U is a hypothetical online art museum and my portfolio website exhibiting my artworks with the concept of the museum.
						<br> It has three main objectives : artist portfolio, art museum, and creative network. You get to know who I am, what I work on, my potential, and you can see my works and various artists' exhibitions.
						<br>All of you who make artworks are artists, you can exhibit, sell your works and buy other's works. In the digital age where we do social activities online, this is one of the creative platforms that connect people around the world beyond space and time.</dd>
					</dl>
				</div>
				<div class="txt02 txt">
					<h4>02</h4>
					<dl>
						<dt>TASK</dt>
						<dd>The main task of this website is to display my works that are for branding myself, provide people with opportunities to enjoy artworks freely, and create a platform for anyone to do creative work as an artist.
						<br>  3 reasons why we need this complex online platform.
						<br>- Many artists launch their own websites, display their works and introduce themselves online. 
						<br>- In the virtual beyond physical space, digital artworks are also very diverse, and audiences have artistic experience online more and more. When you go to the museum in person, there are many etiquettes to follow, and you can't freely appreciate the work. Authoritative art galleries create invisible walls between artworks and audiences.
						<br>- All of you who are always with art are artists, but it's hard to have the opportunity to display your work in art galleries. 
						<br>
						<br>Therefore, the design concept is dedicated specifically to these directions.</dd>
					</dl>
				</div>
				<div class="txt03 txt">
					<h4>03</h4>
					<dl>
						<dt>SOLUTION</dt>
						<dd>This website has been made based on 3 goals.
						<br>First of all, I mainly used red and black to give users a strong impression.
						<br>The main page contains a video to attract viewers' attention and the exhibitions.
						<br>All the subpage was structured into the necessary page based on 3 objectives and lastly, added a web store like a souvenir shop.</dd>

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.

				<h3>Logo</h3>
				<div class="leftbox">
					<i>Inspired by</i>
					<p><img src="../images/about/kandinsky.jpg"></p>
					<p style="text-align:right; padding-bottom:10px;">Composition VIII by Wassily Kandinsky</p>
					<p style="text-align:right;"><img src="../images/about/mondrian.jpg"></p>
					<span>Composition no.II by Piet Mondrian</span>
				</div>
				<div class="rightbox">
					<h4>Composition 2.0</h4>
					<img src="../images/about/gridlogo.png">
					<img src="../images/about/logogroup.png">
					<p>Modernism began on canvas with geometric and simple dot, line, and face, and its composition became more solid in the digital screen in the era of online. These basic  geometrical figures, which are simple but based on accuracy, are best depicted on virtual digital screen rather than on analog surface. 
					<br>Therefore, they fit for the concept of an online art museum that can be enjoyed through the digital devices, and the expression of the brand logo legible and simple to give the impression of easy accessibility of 'online'.</p>
